# NOISECAPT - a Bash shell script to continuously capture audio levels from a standard audio device
#
# Note: this script is meant to be run as a daemon using SYSTEMD
# If run manually, it will continuously loop to listen for new planes
#
# This script is distributed as part of the PlaneFence package.
